  <p align="center" class="body">ACCESSIBILITY</p>
  <p align="center" class="body">Access is in our name and DNA.<br>
    Our mission is to create access where once there were barriers. People with disabilities deserve access to the things that provide a quality of life expected by all. In the digital space they deserve superior access that respects their dignity as People and makes their challenges disappear. People should not serve technology. Technology should serve People.</p>
